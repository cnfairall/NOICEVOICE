## About the User
- The ideal user for this application is a karaoke competition organizer.
- They need to publish team members and details so people can see who is competing.
- The app allows users to visually organize their teams.

## Features
- The app uses Firebase to store created teams and team members.
- Users can view all competing members, all teams, and members filtered by team.
- When a user creates or edits a team or a team member, that object is saved to Firebase and prints to the DOM.
- When a user deletes a team or team member, that object is deleted from Firebase and removed from the DOM. When a team is deleted, its members are also deleted.
- Users can search members by name!
